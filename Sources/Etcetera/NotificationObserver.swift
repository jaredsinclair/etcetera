///
///     private var observer = NotificationObserver()
///
/// and trust ARC to release the observer at the appropriate time, which will
/// remove all observations. This assumes, of course, that all blocks passed to
/// `when(_:perform:)` do not strongly capture `self`.

    /// later on, if desired. This is not necessary for general use, however.
